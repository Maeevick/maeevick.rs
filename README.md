# Experimental maeevick.com with Rust

I (re)build my website with Rust an experiment with its ecosystem

I test several ways.

## Core Tools 
- [x] HTML5 : basic.
- [x] CSS with Tailwind: need some Trunk's config and/or NPX but stays my favorite CSS tool.
- [x] Github Actions: Keep it simple regarding the project nature (website) and the complexity (none).

- [x] Actix-Web: API and Web Server development
