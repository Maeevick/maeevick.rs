# Experimental maeevick.com with Rust

I (re)build my website with Rust an experiment with its ecosystem

- [x] Yew: pretty straight forward for a former React / Elm developer.
- [x] Trunk: recommended by Yew's team and pretty cool tool.
- [x] Tailwind: need some Trunk's config and NPX but stays my favorite CSS tool.
- [x] Github Actions: Keep it simple regarding the project nature (website) and the complexity (none).

- [x] Actix-Web: API development
- [ ] _Maud: html Macro todo_ ?
