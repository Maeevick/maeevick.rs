# Experimental maeevick.com with Rust

I (re)build my website with Rust an experiment with its ecosystem!

I test several ways. It's so fun!

## Core Stack and Tools
- [x] HTML5 : some basic HTML pages.
- [x] CSS with Tailwind: powerfull atomic css toolbet (pre-compiled in docker or with `run.sh` and `cargo watch`).
- [x] JS script: a simple _Service Worker implementation_ to handle offline on mobile.
- [x] __Rust: it's the core of this project -> experiment and learn.__

- [X] Docker, DockerHub and docker-compose: to build a secure and light binary and keep stuff simple.
- [x] Github Actions: keep it simple regarding the project nature (website) and the complexity (none).

- [x] Actix-Web: API and Web Server development.
